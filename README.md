papers2ads
==========

python script replaces entries in the bibtex library created by 
Papers with those found in ADS (Astrophysics Data System) without modifying 
the cite-key.

Papers is a wonderfull tool to download and organize academic papers. Unfortunaelly,
the metadata it collects is often incomplete, so that article bibliographies have to be
curated by hand. Here is where papers2ads comes in. It will read the bibtex
file exported by Papers and fetch the corresponding references from ADS and 
merge them with the human-readable citation keys (citekeys) generated by Papers. One
ends up with the best of both worlds: Compelte and curated ADS bibtex metadata and
the abilty to search and organize articles with Papers software.  

*** To run papers2ads.py on your Papers library, simply export the library as a
bibtex file (e.g., test.bib) and then run:
- python papers2ads test.bib -
